**Comments:**

I enjoyed a lot working on this project.Having stayed in Sydney for 5 years near the beautiful Manly beach,I wanted to recreate the experience of staying near beach.

**Project Highlights:**
The project took me 30 hours to complete.It took me 5 hours to design the room layout, choose color theme for walls and the various objects.
I chose seafoam color and turquoise green for the couch fabric and the wall cabinets and matched them with shiny white benchtops and kitchen objects.As a background I chose the walls as beige color to reflect the sand.
I went with a large wall clock instead of canvas paintings and chose the texture of that clock as sea blue and sand color.
I decided to choose Ambient light as light blue to reflect the outside blue greyish color of the sky.Since I didnot want any reflections of the window glass on the inside of the apartment so I chose reflection source to none.

**Challenges Faced:**

Being a beginner, I faced lot of challenges right from the design aspect in Unity to building and then testing.
Reading the previous queries posted by other students and guidance from the forum mentors and my personal mentor Antonis helped me in finishing the project.
Listed below are the challenges faced by me during the project work duration:
1. Creating a custom skybox using Beach stereoscopic panorama.
2. Aligning and placing various objects so that they are on floor or likewise and not seem to float on air.
2. Applying the textures to materials in Unity while retaining the patterns.I had to do a lot of research for the patterns on wallcabinets and the wall clock to get the effect I wanted.Changing the tiling values of the material helped.
3. Globe spin and alignment with the parent.I wasnot aware of the global and local coordinates in Unity editor , the tip to choose empty game object as parent helped.Globe would spin 360 deg and then there used to be a lag before it would start to spin again,I was able to  solve this by choosing a linear curve as I noticed I needed to add few more keypoints to make the curve smoother.
4. Achieving the desired color on walls was the biggest challenge as everytime I would bake, it would turn to chocolate dark ,I noticed I hadn't changed few of the object materials to the desired shader and that was creating problem.
5. Finally placement of lights in the scene to achieve the desired effect.I didnot want too much of light inside the apartment, chose a spotlight on top of Globe and few area lights to have the desired effect.

**What I liked:**
Overall this project had been fun and I learned a great deal by working on it.I enjoyed almost every aspect of this project right from designing, working around in Unity,reading the forum queries and answers for my doubts, getting help from mentors and finally building and testing the project on the phone till the desired effect was achieved.
I still have a long road to go,next thing on my todo list is in addition to working on Project 3,
Indepth study of how to place lights so that I can achieve realism in my scene.There are some good books on Amazon which am intending to read.
