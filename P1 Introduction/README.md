**Project Name:** Udacity carnival

**Project Objective:** Customise the Carnival scene and deploy it to Android device.The goal of this project was basic familiarisation with the Unity editor, navigating around in Unity and getting the project deployed from Unity to Android/iOS.

**Project Settings:** 
  Unity 5.6.1p2
  GoogleVR UnitySDK:1.50.0
      
**Installation on Android:**
This project has been built using Android as the platform.
Install the app by copying the Carnival.apk from the Build directory onto the android device and installing the app by clicking on it.

**Project Task:**
The Udacity Carnival consists of 3 Mini-Games: Plinko, Wheel of Fortune, and Coin Toss. With each game, you earn points. When you earn 2000 points, you will receive a virtual classic Carnival prize!Task was to fix the broken Carnival game.
Plinko:In this minigame, clicking on the Plinko object, the coin would just drop with not much variance to the oscillation, thus resulting in a score of 200 in most cases.We were supposed to add some variance to the game by changing the oscillation speed and distance so as to add some variance to the scores.
Wheel of Fortune: We were provided with a wheel which always scored 100 points no matter what.Task was to customise the mini game such that when the wheel lands on smaller wedges, player would score more than when on larger wedges.We had to change value against smaller wedges provided in the text input box.
Coin Toss : In this mini game, when the user would throw the coin , it would just drop to the ground.We were supposed to change the min and max toss power such that the coin would land on the ground when the power scale is 50%.

**Extra Features Added**
Added firework particle effect and balloons behind the tent.

** Challenges:**
Figuring out the min and max toss power so that the coin lands on the ground when power scale is up 50%.We had been given a hint to look for a hidden code within the scene to unlock the values.
