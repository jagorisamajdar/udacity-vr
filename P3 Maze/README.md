**Developer Name:** Jagori Samajdar

**Project Name:** Walking the Maze

**Project Objective:** Build a Maze environment which you can navigate around , pick collectibles along  the way to the temple, find and get key to Temple door and finally Exit the Maze.


**Project Settings:** 
  Unity 5.5.1f1
  GoogleVR UnitySDK:1.0
      
**Installation on Android:**

 This project has been built using Android as the platform.
 Install the app by copying the Maze.apk from the Build directory onto the android device and installing the app by clicking on it.

**Project Highlights:**
 The project took me 20 hours to complete.It took me about 1 hour to design the Maze layout on paper, deciding on the Entry and Exit point and where to hide the key.I wanted to place the key in a not so obvious place so I decided to hide it near some trees inside the Maze.I went with a simple Maze design and reused the prefabs provided by Udacity with this project

**Challenges Faced:** 
      Listed below are the challenges faced by me during the project work duration:
      
      1. Designing the Maze scene,aligning the walls and putting together the entire scene.It was very difficult to work in the small Scene view.I learnt how to maximise Scene view window using Shift and Space key together.
      
      2.Adding water particle effect to the fountains and not letting the particles pass through the terrain.
      
      3.Playing audio on Door using AudioClip array.
      
      4.Baking the scene was the toughest, I applied whatever knowledge I had gained in Project2 and that seemed to work although baking did take around 10 mins.
      
      5.Adding Event System and Event trigger to the scene to make interactable objects such as the coin and the key.  
Overall a wonderful project to learn about scripting, references , event system and UI.

**To Do List**
I would be interested in learning an efficient way of creating the Maze scene instead of creating duplicates of walls.Possibly use of Maze generator algo.
